Favicons
========

Generate your favicon in different sizes:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon-96x96.png" sizes="96x96" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon-196x196.png" sizes="196x196" />
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico" sizes="32x32" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" type="image/png" href="apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png" sizes="152x152" />
```

* All favicon files should be located in the document root directory.

There are also images used for [Microsoft's `browserconfig.xml`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn320426(v=vs.85).aspx).

For the current state of affairs in regards to favicons consult [audreyr's favicon-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/audreyr/favicon-cheat-sheet).

Favicons can be generated by calling `grunt image_resize` from your projects base directory.

OG:Images
---------

Every page should have it's own preview image, referenced by this code:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="{{BASE_URL}}{{IMAGE_URL}}" />
```

According to Facebook this image should be at least 200Ã—200 pixels.
