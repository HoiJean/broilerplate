Server stuff
============

For virtualisation to work you will need a VM client. You may want to use.

* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)


Web server in a box
--------------------

You may want to use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). This will offer you an easy setup for virtual machines.

This project comes pre-equipeed with [Scotch Box](https://box.scotch.io/). For more complex setups consider using [PuPHPet](https://puphpet.com/).

The most important commands:

* `vagrant up`: Start/resume your server
* `vagrant suspend`: Pause your server. You should do this before shutting down your computer.
* `vagrant destroy`: Delete your server
* `vagrant ssh`: SSH into your server

Testing for IE
--------------

If you would like to test your site with older versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, head over to their [collection of virtual machines with different versions of Windows & Internet Explorer](https://www.modern.ie/de-de/virtualization-tools).
