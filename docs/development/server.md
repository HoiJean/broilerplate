Server stuff
============

For virtualisation to work you will need a VM client. You may want to use.

* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)


Web server in a box
--------------------

You may want to use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). This will offer you an easy setup for virtual machines.

There are preconfigured machines to help you get started:

* [Scotch Box](https://box.scotch.io/)
* [PuPHPet](https://puphpet.com/)

Testing for IE
--------------

If you would like to test your site with older versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, head over to their [collection of virtual machines with different versions of Windows & Internet Explorer](https://www.modern.ie/de-de/virtualization-tools).
